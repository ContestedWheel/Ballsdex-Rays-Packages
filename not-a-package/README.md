# Code Snippets Collection

## Overview

This folder contains various code snippets I've written, and I'll try to guide you as much as possible on how to place them in the right context.

## Features

- **Unique Features**: Some of these features you won't find on the market
- **Innovative Implementations**: Some features are pretty much the same as existing solutions, but I didn't realize anyone else was doing them while I was developing them

## Usage

The usage of individual code is described in the code's file.

*It's important to note that these code snippets have been transported from my own bot, and the text has been translated, so it should work, but there's no guarantee that I'll forget to tell you what to import, so if you run into an error, you can either fix it yourself and open a PR, or contact me.*
