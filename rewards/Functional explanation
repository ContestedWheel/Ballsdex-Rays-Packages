This package provides a reward distribution system for a Discord bot.

## Features
- Administrators can batch distribute rewards to selected users based on economy type, regime type, rarity, and other criteria.
- Users can claim pending rewards via commands.

## How to Distribute Rewards
- Administrators can use the `/rewards distribute` command to send rewards.
- You can specify criteria such as economy type, regime type, rarity range, number of rewards, and target users or roles.
- After executing the command, the system will notify eligible users and allow them to claim their rewards via `/rewards claim`. 

## User Experience
- When a reward is distributed, users will receive a private message notification (if possible) informing them about the reward type and details, and instructing them to use `/rewards claim` to receive it.
- Users can use the `/rewards claim` command to view and claim their pending rewards. If there are no pending rewards, they will see a message indicating that there are no rewards to claim.
- After claiming, users will receive a confirmation message showing the reward they received.
